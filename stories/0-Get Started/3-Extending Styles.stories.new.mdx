# Extending Styles

Although themeing via css variables enables a developer to easily customize the colors of the components. It also
limits on sizes. I could have exposed these as variables too. But felt that it would make components too complex
as I would need to repeateadly use `calc` to keep various dimentions (like width, height, margin, and padding) in sync.
Also, my approach to have a `Group` component mandates all these components to work in sync out of the box.

So instead I settled for `style` prop. This way my life remains simple and developer can override and create components
with custom styles on top of it in a wrapper component and use them instead. However, this overhead means a poor
developer experience as the developer needs to pass styles in object instead of css strings. Which is not a preferred
way for many developers.

To make it less painful, `css` and `jsx` functions from `@emotion/core` can be used. Emotion is what I used for creating
most of these components so ideally it shouldn't add to your bundle size. You can use it as described below.

**Example**

```jsx
/** @jsx jsx */
import { css, jsx } from '@emotion/core';
import { ActionButton } from "no-frills-ui";

export function LargeButton(props) {
    return (
        <ActionButton
            css={css`
                height: 40px;
                min-width: 200px;
                font-size: 16px;
                padding: 0 16px;
            `}
            {...props}
        />
    );
}
```

A lot is happening here that you should be aware of. The comment on the first line tells `babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx`
to use `jsx` imported from emotion. This may not work out of the box for you. So you might need to refer
[emotion's guide on css prop](https://emotion.sh/docs/css-prop#jsx-pragma).

The `jsx` function looks for `css` prop and the styles supplied to the prop are evaluated and the computed class name
is applied to the `className` prop.

If configuring this proves to be too much trouble, then [raise an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/pushkar8723/no-frills-ui/issues/new)
and let me know the use case too. I may decide to refactor the components and introduce css variables for it.
