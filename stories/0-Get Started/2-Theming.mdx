# Theming

I used CSS variables to style each component with a fallback value. What this means is that you can directly use the
component without any theming if you like the blue theme that I followed. Or you can choose to override them by
setting values to each of these variable in `:root` selector.

**Example**

```css
:root {
    --primary: darkorange;
    --primary-light: orange;
}
```

Further, these variables can also be overriden at a block level.

**Example**

```css
.block {
    --primary: darkgreen;
    --primary-light: green;
}
```

You can also style each component by passing a `style` prop or if you like you can set a `className` and then override
style to these class. This should work fine for small tweaks like overriding `width` of the component. But if you want
to do it for a lot of styles, your code quality may take a hit. For such cases refer our
[extending styles guide](/?path=/docs/get-started-extending-styles--page).
