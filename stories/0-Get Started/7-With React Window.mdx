# With React Window

One of the challenge I have seen in UI development is having a list of very large number of items. The problem is
not that we don't have tools for such problem. Actually we have many. But there are many such small problems which
when bundled in a component library, would lead to bloat and may not be required for many projects.

Hence, while creating the `Menu` component, I kept the API such that it can easily work with such tools. Below I created
a codesandbox demo where I used `Dropdown` component with `react-window` to render a list of 1000 items. It showcases
how a virtualized list library can used inside a `Dropdown`. Similar approach can be taken for `Menu` as well.

If your projects requires a lot of different Dropdowns with virtualized list, then I recommend creating a wrapper component
around `Dropdown` with `react-window` and then use this wrapper at all such places.

This way the library remains lean and virtualization can be used as an when needed.
