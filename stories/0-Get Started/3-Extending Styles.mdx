# Extending Styles

Although themeing via css variables enables a developer to easily customize the colors of the components. It also
limits on sizes. I could have exposed these as variables too. But felt that it would make components too complex
as I would need to repeateadly use `calc` to keep various dimentions (like width, height, margin, and padding) in sync.
Also, my approach to have a `Group` component mandates all these components to work in sync out of the box.

So instead I settled for `style` prop. This way my life remains simple and developer can override and create components
with custom styles on top of it in a wrapper component and use them instead. However, this overhead means a poor
developer experience as the developer needs to pass styles in object instead of css strings. Which is not a preferred
way for many developers.

To make it less painful, `styled` from `@emotion/styled` can be used. Emotion is what I used for creating
most of these components so ideally it shouldn't add to your bundle size. You can use it as described below.

**Example**

```jsx
import styled from '@emotion/styled';
import { ActionButton } from 'no-frills-ui';

const LargeActionButton = styled(ActionButton)`
    height: 40px;
    min-width: 200px;
    font-size: 16px;
    padding: 0 16px;
`;

export function LargeButton(props) {
    return <LargeActionButton {...props} />;
}
```
