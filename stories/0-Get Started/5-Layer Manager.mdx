# Layer Manager

Inspired from `react-layer-manager`, I created a layer manager. But since I wanted there to be no boilerplate
code, I didn't use react context. Instead created a Singleton class to manage layers. All no frills ui components
that renders in a seperate DOM tree than application will get the layer from this service.

This ensures that user will never have to worry about the `z-index` on which the component will render and can
continue to nest components as per the requirement. For example, a user can keep opening dialogs one after another
and each dialog will render in a seperate layer.

This layer also takes care of managing stack and overlay and can close a layer on click of `esc` key. All these
behaviour can be customized.

**Example**

<div>{LayerManagerStories.Demo.render()}</div>

Following components use layer mananger
