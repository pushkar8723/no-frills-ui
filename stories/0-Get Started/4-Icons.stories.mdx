# Icons

To put it simply, icons are included. ðŸ˜…

Creating a component library is a huge task in itself. I didn't want to add the complexity of creating an icon library
on top of it. When there is already very rich set of Icons libraries present on the internet for free use. However, I
haven't left you high and dry in this regard.

You can choose your icon library as per your requirement. If you settle for a font based icon library, then no extra
effort is required as the icons are just another text on DOM. But if you want to use an SVG icon, there are components that
will override `height`, `width` and `fill` props of SVG to have a seemless experience of using the SVG icon.

#### Example of `IconButton`

```jsx
import { IconButton } from 'no-frills-ui';
import SVGIcon from '../path/to/svg/icon'; // your svg icon

// render
<IconButton><SVGIcon /></IconButton>
```

Following components support having an SVG component inside them.
