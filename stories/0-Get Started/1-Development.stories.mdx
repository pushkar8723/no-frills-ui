# Development

Development with `no-frills-ui` is pretty staright forward.

### Installation

`react` and `react-dom` are peer dependencies and needs to be installed for `no-frills-ui`.

```bash
npm i react react-dom no-frills-ui
```

### Using a component

`no-frills-ui` exports each component as a stand alone react component and so doesn't need any context
to be configured at root. You can directly import a component and put it on your react component.

**Example: Using `Button`**

```jsx
import { Button } from 'no-frills-ui';

// Use Button in your render function
<Button>Just a button</Button>
```

### Theming

For themeing we use CSS variables. Checkout the details on our [theming page](/?path=/docs/get-started-theming--page).

### Cost of using a component

`no-frills-ui` is completely tree shakable and you can checkout our export analysis on
[BundlePhobia](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=no-frills-ui).
