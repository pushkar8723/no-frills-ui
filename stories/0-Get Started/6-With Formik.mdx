# With Formik

My choice of library for form handling is `formik` with `yup` for validation. Hence, I made sure that all
the components are compatible with `formik`. `formik` provides `Field` component that works nicely with
native elements and since most of our inputs are just styled native elements, it is quite easy to use with
`formik`.

The exception to this is complex components like `Dropdown` and `ChipInput`. For these components, additional
`value` and `onChange` handler needs to be passed.

The following demo shows all these components in action with `formik` and `yup`.
