# Modal

Component that renders in another layer. I used a custom layer manager for this. This ensures that the
modal always renders on top of whatever is opened without any need of `z-index` attribute.

I also exported `ModalHeader`, `ModalBody` and `ModalFooter` components. These are there only to help with
styling the modal and adds no additional functionality.

**Why is there a `Dialog` component?**

`Modal` takes declarative approach to manage component's state. Whereas `Dialog` take an imperative approach.
This is because a lot of time we just want to show/get certain information to/from the user in an async way
and then continue with our work. Having a declarative approach fragments the logic in such cases. However, I
didn't want to have a component that does both. Hence, the two component to power the same user experience.
But at the same time enhancing the developer experience at the cost of one additional component.
