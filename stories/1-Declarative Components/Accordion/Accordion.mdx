# Accordion

Custom implementation to create an Accordion. There are 2 components that are used here together to create an Accordion.
`Accordion` and `AccordionStep`. `Accordion` is the outer wrapper and has `active` and `onStepClick` props.
Whereas each step in accordion is defined using `AccordionStep` component and has `header`, `errorText`, `completed`
and `disabled` props. Each step is focusable and only one step can be opened at a time.

`AccordionStepBody` and `AccordionStepFooter` are two components which helps in maintaining the design language of
the components and are completely optional to use.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.Default} className="canvas-background"/>

```jsx
import { Accordion, AccordionStep } from 'no-frills-ui';

// Render
<Accordion>
    <AccordionStep header='Welcome'>
        Dummy content for Welcome step
    </AccordionStep>
    <AccordionStep header='Basic Details' completed>
        Dummy content for Basic Details step
    </AccordionStep>
    <AccordionStep header='Personalisation' errorText='3 Errors' disabled>
