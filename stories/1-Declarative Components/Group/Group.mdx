# Group

This component groups multiple `inputs` / `buttons` / `labels` together.

I find this a better solution for grouping elements instead of having `prefix` and `suffix` props. Also, it
solves the problem of grouping more than 2 components. Only demerit of going by this method is an extra `errorText`
prop is needed to be exposed at group level and the individual component's `errorText` cannot be used.

A `GroupLabel` component is available for prepending / appending label to the group.

## Multiple components

<Canvas of={GroupStories.MultipleComponents} />

## Group Label at start

<Canvas of={GroupStories.GroupLabelStart} />

## Group Label at end

<Canvas of={GroupStories.GroupLabelEnd} />

## Error Text

<Canvas of={GroupStories.WithErrorText} />

### Props

<Controls of={GroupStories.Primary} />
