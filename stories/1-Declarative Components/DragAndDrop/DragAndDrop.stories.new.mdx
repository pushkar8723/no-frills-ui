# DragAndDrop

`DragAndDrop` is a controlled component and will require `onDrop` prop to function properly.
It can be used to create a rearrangeable list. It supports both vertical and horizontal orientation for the list.

Additionally, there is a `showIndicator` prop which shows an indicator against the component and the list item
can only be dragged using this indicator when this prop is set to true. This can be used in case the item to be dragged
has some mouse events of its own and we require an explicit user input for drag to handle such case.

> **Limitation**: Currently drag across list is not supported.
